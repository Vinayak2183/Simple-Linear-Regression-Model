# Simple-Linear-Regression-Model
## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Simple Linear Regression model to predict Salary based on the number of Years of Experience of an individual. The goal is to provide insights into how years of experience influence salary and create a predictive model for estimating salaries for unseen data.
## Features
Uses Years of Experience as the feature (independent variable).
* Salary as the label (dependent variable).
* End-to-end machine learning workflow:
** Data preprocessing and visualization.
** Model training using simple linear regression.
** Model evaluation and visualization of results.
** Salary prediction for custom input values.
