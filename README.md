# Simple-Linear-Regression-Model
## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Simple Linear Regression model to predict Salary based on the number of Years of Experience of an individual. The goal is to provide insights into how years of experience influence salary and create a predictive model for estimating salaries for unseen data.
## Features
Uses Years of Experience as the feature (independent variable).
* Salary as the label (dependent variable).
* End-to-end machine learning workflow:
       * Data preprocessing
       * Model training using simple linear regression.
       * Model evaluation and visualization of results.
       * Salary prediction for custom input values.
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains two columns:
1 Years of Experience: The number of years a person has worked.
2 Salary: The corresponding salary for each individual.
## Requirements
The following Python libraries are required to run the project:
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* scikit-learn
# Implementation
Steps:
* Load the dataset:
Import and read the dataset using Pandas.
* Model training:
Train a Simple Linear Regression model using the scikit-learn library.
* Data visualization:
Use Matplotlib to create scatter plots of Years of Experience vs. Salary.
* Results visualization:
Plot the regression line along with the data points.
* Prediction:
Allow users to input years of experience and predict the corresponding salary.
